## Description

In this project, I aim to create a robust API for a social networking web application using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for data storage, and Mongoose ODM for seamless interaction with the database. The API will help users to share their thoughts, react to their friends' posts, and manage their friend lists efficiently.


## Installation

* Click the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.
* Open your terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
* Run git clone 
* update (dotenv) file

## Usage

Interacting with the API: Utilize tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API endpoints. Refer to the API documentation for a comprehensive list of available endpoints, their respective HTTP methods, request payloads, and response formats.

User Authentication: For endpoints requiring authentication, include the user's authentication token in the request headers. Upon successful authentication, the server will validate the token and grant access to the requested resources.

Testing Endpoints: Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to test the endpoints based on their intended functionalities. Ensure to provide valid input data and handle responses accordingly.

Monitoring Server Logs: Monitor the server logs in the terminal to track incoming requests, server responses, errors, and any relevant information for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

Managing the Database: Use MongoDB commands or a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass to manage the database. Verify that data is being stored correctly and reflect changes made through API interactions.
